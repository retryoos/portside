"""invitations.accepted_by_sub

Revision ID: d4e5f6a7b8c9
Revises: c3d4e5f6a7b8

Track who consumed each invitation so the accept route can distinguish
"this user re-accepting their own invite" from "another user touching a
used token." Closes the W9 idempotency edge case where the original
acceptor's repeat-click was confusingly 410ing.

Backfill is safe: existing accepted rows don't know the original acceptor.
For those, the column stays NULL and the route falls back to the strict
behaviour (treat re-accept as 410) until a new accept overwrites it. That
matches the pre-migration behaviour, so no in-flight invites change shape.
